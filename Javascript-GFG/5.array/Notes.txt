Array
=====

   - array is non-primitive data type

   - in JavaScript array is a single variable that stores multiple elements.

   -  There are basically two ways to declare an array.
            
                - var House = [ ]; // Method 1
                - var House = new Array(); // Method 2
           
                -  But generally method 1 is preferred over method 2.

of used in for
--------------
   - it will print the value


in used in for
--------------
   - it will print the index


Copying an Array --> Array Reference
------------------------------------
   - assign one array value to another array


Spread Operator (...)
--------------------

   - when we are copying one array value to another array at that time it is refering the same memory location to avaoid this we can use - Spread Operator


Array Methods
-------------
   
    - push()        ----> To add something to array (we can add more than one items)

    - concat()      ----> It will combine the more than two array

    - pop()         ----> Remove last item from an array

    - slice()       ----> Returns a copy of a section of an array. For both start and end, a negative index can be used to indicate an offset from the end of the array. For example, -2 refers to the second to last element of the array.

    - splice()      ----> Removes elements from an array and, if necessary, inserts new elements in their place, returning the deleted elements.

    - includes()   -----> 





Mutable & Immutable
-------------------
   - Mutable is change
   - Immutable is not change




Array Sort
----------
   
 - sort() - Function used to determine the order of the elements




Split and Join 
--------------
  
 - split()    ----> Split a string into substrings using the specified separator and return them as an array.

 - join()     ----> Adds all the elements of an array into a string, separated by the specified separator string.


Spread
-------
 
 - ...array
