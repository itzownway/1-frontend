More About Functions
====================

pure Functions
--------------
   - It takes an argument
   - It should return something
   - For same input you should get the same output
   - The result should not be influenced by outer parameter
   - It should not mutate the original argument

first class functions
---------------------
    - In javascript functions are basically treated as first class citizens.


    What is First Class Citizens 
    -----------------------------
          - a function is called as a first class function as well of first class citizens.
               the meaning of that function can be 
                      - a function can be assigned to a variable
                      - a function can be passsed as an argument to another function
                      - a function can be return by another function


 What is the purpose of an argument object in javascript

           - It is used to store values passsed to a function          


Higher Order Function
---------------------
    - A function that accepts another function as an argument or return a function or does both is called a H.O.F

    
     - calculate the square and cube of numbers using higher order function.

 Map
 ----
    -     




 Filter
 -------

      - it take the callback function as an argument


Reduce 
-------

    - it is also take the callback function as an argument

Scope and Scope Chain
=====================
   - function can access the global variable
   - inner function can access the outer function variable due to lexical Scope


What is lexical Scope
---------------------
    A lexical environment in JavaScript refers to the set of variables, functions, and 
    other data structures that are available in a particular section of code during its execution. It consists of two parts: 
    a variable environment and a reference to the outer lexical environment

  Whenever a function executes it has 2 things.
        1)Variable Environment
        2)Reference to Outer Lexical Environment that is the Parent's lexical Environment.

 Recursion
 ---------
      - Function call itself.
